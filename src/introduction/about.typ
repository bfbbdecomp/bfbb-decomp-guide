== About this Book

Welcome to the exciting world of video game decompilation!
This book serves as an introduction to the BFBB Decompilation Project
#footnote("https://github.com/bfbbdecomp"),
which is an organized community effort to reverse engineer the source code of
the 2003 platform game "SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom" (BFBB) for Nintendo GameCube.


=== What You Will Learn

The main goal of this book is to act as a complete guide that can take someone
with the #link(<knowledge>, [required prerequisite knowledge])
from zero understanding of decompilation and assembly code to being able to read, understand, and 
decompile BFBB's C++ source code and corresponding assembly code.

So what does this mean for you?

If you read through this book
you will learn about BFBB's game engine,
the decompilation process,
and how C++ code translates to assembly.
You will deepen your understanding of computer science,
You will gain the knowledge required to be able to create your own custom mods
and builds of BFBB.
And most excitingly,
you will get an exclusive look behind the curtains at the source code of
one of your favorite childhood games
and see how the sausage is made.

Your reverse engineering effort will
unearth and give new life to long lost-and-forgotten source code
as if you were a digital archeologist.
It is also likely that your newly decompiled code will run on hundreds of thousands
if not millions of PCs
as the source code will serve as the base for a BFBB PC port.

You have an opportunity to become a part of gaming history.
